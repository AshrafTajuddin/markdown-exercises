>I think it depends on why you think it tastes sub-par. More salt, more curry powder, basil (purple, if you can get it), cumin, coriander, more of your spice mix... there's a lot of directions you can take.
One thing I like to do if I think a dish is lacking is portion it out, then doctor it when I reheat it. That way you can play with what you think makes it better without committing your whole pot to the experiment.
